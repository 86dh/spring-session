= Getting Started

In order to get started using Spring Session, you must choose a persistent store to use.
Spring Session supports a few different persistent stores out-of-the-box:

- https://redis.io/[Redis]
- https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC[JDBC]
- https://hazelcast.com/[Hazelcast]
- https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB]

There are other projects that are not supported by Spring Session, but are supported by the community:

- https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-session-data-geode[Spring Session Data Geode]

Now that you have chosen the persistence store that best fit your needs, you can jump to their respective sections:
